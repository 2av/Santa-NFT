                            <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
                            <p>Royal Santa is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Ethereum network. This website is only an interface allowing participants to purchase digital collectibles. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Furthermore, as the Royal Santa smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.</p>
                            <p>This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving Royal Santa digital collectibles.</p>

                            <h4>2. Ownership</h4>
                            <p>You acknowledge and agree that Creator (or, as applicable, its licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to Royal Santa and all intellectual property rights therein. All rights that are not specifically granted to the users and owners of Royal Santa below are reserved by the team or potential future DAO. This includes but is not limited to the intellectual property rights surrounding the “RoyalSanta” names, logos, 3d layer files, trademarks, the website, the look and feel of the user interface, the smart contract code, or anything else not specifically granted by any following licenses. The rights that you have in and to the Art are limited to those described in this License. Creator reserves all rights in and to Royal Santa not expressly granted to you in this License.  When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Royal Santa, the Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Royal Santa.</p>

                            <p>A. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms of this license, We grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Royal Santa / NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Royal Santa owner’s rights to display the Art for their Royal Santa to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Royal Santa NFTs, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Royal Santa owner’s rights to display the Art for their Royal Santa NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Royal Santa leaves the website/application.</p>
                            <p>B. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, We grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Royal Santa NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Royal Santa owner’s rights to display the Art for their Royal Santa/NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</p>
                            <p>Royal Santa expressly prohibits the use of any proprietary, individual’s traits or crafted layers in any and all other projects. Royal Santa also prohibits the sale or promotion of counterfeit NFTs or NFT collections. Counterfeit NFTs or collections contain art that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the original Royal Santa collection.</p>
